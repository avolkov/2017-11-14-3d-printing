Or How I spent this sprint, summer, autumn and the stupid thing is still going

So the story started some time ago where I was looking to get into 3D printing, and I've been mercilessly exploiting/taking care of hacklab 3d printers, where I printer a phone car holder and a tabled holder (do you see a pattern here?)

I've been following Thomas Salandeerer channel toms3d on youtube, and at some point in february there was a featured series on how to build a 3D printer from scratch.

Here are the videos:
Tom's guilde -- [CIT0001]_ on building the cheapest possible prusa i3


These video series didn't come out of nowhere, it is based on one of more simpler and popular commercial 3d printers that are completely open-source -- Prusa i3 mk2

Prusa i3 mk2 is a part of reprap project build by Joe Prusa, based on Prusa Mendel which itself is based on Prusa Mendel,
