    * Zipties that hold linear bearings on Y-axis get loose over time making print quality really bad. and really hard to diagnoze as it looks like underextrusion. Show printed x-motor-holder.

Common 3d printing issues.
* Z wobble
* bed leveling issues
    * prints fail
    * overextrusion
    * bent rods
* temperature
* cooling
    * part cooling fan for

* Tools
    * Alcohol spray bottle
    * Kapton tape (old school)
    * spatula
    * pincers
    * Metric hex screwdriver
    * snips
    * smaller pincers
    * automotive pincers for heater block
    * acetone
* Printing with materials properties -- advantages/downsides
* PLA
* ABS
* ABS+ (stronger but not any easier to print)
* PETG (Only slightly more expensive than pla)

Exotics: Nylon, ASA, Solubles



Issues
* temperature
* cooling
* overhangs
* slicer settings

Debugging
* 3D benchy

* Purpose
    * Improvements:
    * layer adhesion
    * layer shifting
    * ABS / ASA layer improvement
* Version 1 -- really cheap, Lacking + polyurethane tape
* Version 2 --

G28
G29 -> needs to be adjusted because frame is thinker than aluminum one

* project parts
* stuff on thingiverse
* thingiverse (with caveats)
* youmagine
* parametric parts (good stuff) for openscad -- basically a source code that every admin/programmer can understand.
* onshape
* fusion 360 (with caveats)
